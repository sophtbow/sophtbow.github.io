                I conducted UX research for the Bennington County Conservation District to assess their website usability. Talking to the director
                about their pain points and what the organization envisions for the website was crucial to developing recommendations that would
                fit BCCD and their goals. Within a small team, I conducted several UX research methods, including Comparative Analysis, 
                Card Sorting, Tree Testing, Surveys, Voice Chart, and User Personas.

                I worked with Figma to create mockups of the website's current information architecture, our proposed one, and the final recommended
                information architecture. I designed and delivered a comprehensive usability report with actionable design recommendations 
                for improvement on the website and greater usability.

                Through this project, I gained so many meaningful skills in UX research and writing for UX. I highly recommend reading
